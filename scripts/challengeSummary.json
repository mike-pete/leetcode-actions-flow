		"# LeetCode Solutions\nAs solutions to LeetCode challenges are added to the solutions folder, Github Actions automatically generate documentation from the challenge description on [LeetCode.com](http://leetcode.com)",
		"## Usage\nAdd solutions to LeetCode challenges, inside a directory named after the challenge, to the solutions directory. The directory name must match the name of a LeetCode challenge. If the challenge directory does not contain a README, GitHub Actions will generate one from the challenge description on LeetCode.com and add it to the table on the main repo README.\n\n## Authors\n- [Michael Peterson](https://github.com/kid-on-github)\n- [Andrew Larson](https://github.com/Kefka174)\n#### [fork the project](https://github.com/kid-on-github/leetcode-actions-flow)"
